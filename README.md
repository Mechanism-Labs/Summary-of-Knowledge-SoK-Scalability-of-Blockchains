# Summary-of-Knowledge-SoK-Scalability-of-Blockchains

This paper aims to offer a collection of the most popular blockchain scalability solutions. The main goal is to give a fundamental understanding of each solution and how each follows different methods to find its own respective balance in the tradeoff outlined by the scalability trilemma - decentralization vs. security vs. scalability. The paper considers each solution from the various layers of a blockchain based on this layout (https://medium.com/mechanism-labs/the-blockchain-stack-ca953c088692).
